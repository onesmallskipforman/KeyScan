# KeyScan

KeyScan is a SystemVerilog keypad scanner designed to display keypad inputs
on an M-digit common-anode 7-segment display.

Several of the SystemVerilog modules are generalized and could be used in other projects. I keep all of my multi-purpose SystemVerilog modules in another repo of mine, [SV-Toolbox](https://github.com/onesmallskipforman/SV-Toolbox).
